Server Pre-training for Federated Learning

This repository holds the code and resources required for pre-training the server model that will later be used in a Federated Learning architecture.

The goal of this pre-training is to establish a solid foundation for the global model before the iterative federated learning process begins. This ensures the server already possesses relevant initial knowledge, which can help improve the overall convergence and performance of the Federated Learning system.

Here you'll find the scripts for data preparation and server model training.
